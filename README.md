Some Components of my F.U.S.E Box Cyberdeck for those interested

I did a video on my Build Process:

## Disclaimer:
The Contents of this repo are (and will stay) pretty alpha, since I made my deck as a one-off and did not intend to make it a kit or so.
But since people asked me for the files and I don't mind sharing them I uploaded them here.
For the 3D files, you will likely have to fit them with filing and sawing to your case.
